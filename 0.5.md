##*D*elivery *O*f a *D*atabase *O*verhaul

Hopefully by the time we get here, the Front end will be pretty solid. The database however will need to be looked at. Needs to be amazing! This will be our powerhouse!

 - Analysis: write up some fany Haskell service?
 - push changes to users... convert database to Rethink DB so we can use it's push capabilities?
