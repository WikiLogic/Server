##*D*elivery *O*f a *D*atabase *O*verhaul

Hopefully by the time we get here, the Front end will be pretty solid. The database however will need to be looked at. Needs to be amazing! This will be our powerhouse! In addition there will be some work on the server.

###Which DB to use?

[Titan](http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/)
 - Scales out, we can use clusters.
 - Performant for "hundreds of billions" of edges.
 - Doesn't look very dev friendly.

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)
 - Looks very friendly.
 - Supports Cypher query language (wich looks lovely!).
 - Scaling out to use a cluster would requre a licence / negotiations if they're willing.



Express will need some love and care at this point, it feels a bit brittle

 - [ ] More functional functions.
 - [x] Minimise the API surface, use action objects.
 - [ ] Clear out unused code.
