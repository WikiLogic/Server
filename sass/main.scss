/* 

CONFIG
The various settings / variables that will be used throughout

LIBRARY
mixins / functions
These guys can have their own atomic classes too

TAGS
The default styling for each html tag
and some modifyers for them.

ATOMIC CLASSES
These guys will do the bulk of the work
When you come to adding markup, you should be looking to style it using classes from here
They should get you 90% of the look you're after

LAYOUTS
These create the structurs within which components will live

COMPONENTS
for any tweaking a component needs, 
the bulk of the work should be done already though, these are minimal, 
think carefully before adding anything in here.
