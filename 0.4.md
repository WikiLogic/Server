#Planning for 0.4

##The Database

Convert to use Rethink DB for it's push capabilities.


##Front End

Detach from angular. 
 
###Data Binding 

 - Rivets.js
 

###State handler

 - Redux.js


###Routing
 
###Modules  

Need (really want) to import / destroy specific bits of code depending on where we are in the app.

 - AMD (RequireJS) <- async.
 - CommonJS <- synchronous, unit testing is better.
 - ES 6 Modules <- The future! Not huge suppport yet
 
Webpack - gives us choices, also allows ES6, 'chunks' the code between sync and async, we can choose the breakpoints between chunks. I like the sound of this... And it lets us load other things: css / images / ... ! Am I in hype? I think I'm in hype. But, looks like it's just a dev dependency, installs with npm and runs from gulp. Takes a src file and bundles it into a dist file. hmm... Reading through the docs I'm not as excited. Looking for something leaner.



##Server

 - More functional functions
 - Minimise the API surface, use action objects.



##Data analysis

 - Use Haskell to run 'state' propegation
