#0.4 - Front End: RestRucturing EveryThing... Ferret.


##0.4.1

 - [x] New module loader: Webpack. & Babel for ES6.
 - [ ] Set up server to serve from the dist folder
 - [ ] Build hbs into html
 - [ ] Angular out, ES6 modules in.
 - [ ] Data binding transferred to rivets.js
 - [ ] Client side routing set up with crossroads.js


##0.4.2 - restructure

Currently /views has the base for each route with one for the editor. Angular then holds all the templates in the public folder. Bringing RequireJS (or some es6 transpiled alternative) in with rivets should allow this to change. There should be a root level directory for each mini app: "Editor", "Explorer", ... profile/settings?, map(the threejs canvas madness!)

The server should have it's own directory, this is the guy that will provide the API to each of the front end mini apps & any other third party apps that want to register for use.

The data analysis software will also have it's own directory. 

For now all will be in this repo as there isn't much between them, but by the 1.0 release I'd hope each will be split into their own repos.


##0.4.3 - server love

Express will need some love and care at this point, it feels a bit brittle

 - More functional functions
 - Minimise the API surface, use action objects.


##0.4.4

 - Plan out 0.5, think up a fun name for it.
 - Tag the 0.4 release!
