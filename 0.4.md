#Planning for 0.4

##The Database

Convert to use Rethink DB for it's push capabilities.


##Front End

Detach from angular. 
 
###Data Binding 

 - Rivets.js
 

###State handler

 - Redux.js


###Routing
 
###Modules  

Need (really want) to import / destroy specific bits of code depending on where we are in the app.

 - AMD (RequireJS) <- async. Stable. It works.
 - CommonJS <- synchronous, unit testing is better.
 - ES 6 Modules <- The future! Not huge suppport yet
 
*Webpack* - gives us choices, also allows ES6, 'chunks' the code between sync and async, we can choose the breakpoints between chunks. I like the sound of this... And it lets us load other things: css / images / ... ! Am I in hype? I think I'm in hype. But, looks like it's just a dev dependency, installs with npm and runs from gulp. Takes a src file and bundles it into a dist file. hmm... Reading through the docs I'm not as excited. Looking for something leaner.

*JSPM* - ... 


##Server

 - More functional functions
 - Minimise the API surface, use action objects.


##File structure

Currently /views has the base for each route with one for the editor. Angular then holds all the templates in the public folder. Bringing RequireJS (or some es6 transpiled alternative) in with rivets should allow this to change. There should be a root level directory for each mini app: "Editor", "Explorer", ... profile/settings?, map(the threejs canvas madness!)

The server should have it's own directory, this is the guy that will provide the API to each of the front end mini apps & any other third party apps that want to register for use.

The data analysis software will also have it's own directory. 

For now all will be in this repo as there isn't much between them, but by the 1.0 release I'd hope each will be split into their own repos.


##Data analysis

 - Use Haskell to run 'state' propegation
